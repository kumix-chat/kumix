# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, contact the maintainers privately with:

- a clear description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- potential impact
- any suggested fix or mitigation

## Supported versions

Kumix is currently in pre-release (`0.0.x`). Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis.
